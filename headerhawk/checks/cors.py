"""Active testing of the CORS origin allowlist.

The `Origin` request header decides who is allowed to read a cross-origin
response, which puts it squarely in this scanner's territory: a server that
echoes whatever `Origin` it is handed has no allowlist at all, and with
credentials allowed that is a cross-origin read of authenticated data.

Findings are evidence-driven. A unique per-scan marker is sent as the origin, so
seeing it echoed back in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` proves the server
accepted an origin that cannot exist rather than merely suggesting it.
