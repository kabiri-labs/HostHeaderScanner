"""Web cache deception: a page filed under a key that looks like an asset.

An attacker gets a victim to open `/account/profile.css`. The application's
router ignores the suffix and serves the victim's account page; the CDN sees a
`.css` and files it as a public static asset. The attacker then asks for the
same URL and is handed the victim's page out of the cache.

Two things have to be true, and they are checked separately. The router has to
ignore the suffix - otherwise the URL is a 404 and nothing follows. And a shared
cache has to store the result, which is what turns one victim's page into
everyone's.

The second is proved rather than inferred where it can be: the same URL is
requested again from a session carrying no credentials at all. Content that only
the logged-in session should have seen, coming back to an anonymous one, is a
cache handing a user's page to a stranger.
