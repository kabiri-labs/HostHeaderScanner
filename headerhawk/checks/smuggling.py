"""Timing-based detection of HTTP request smuggling (front-end/back-end desync).

When a front-end and a back-end disagree about where one request ends and the
next begins, the leftover bytes prepend to whoever uses that connection next.
The disagreement is always between two request header fields - Content-Length
and Transfer-Encoding - which is what puts this in a header scanner.

Detection is by timing, and timing alone. A probe is crafted so that the server
that loses the disagreement is left waiting for a body that will never arrive;
if the target hangs where an equivalent well-formed request returns promptly,
the two ends disagree. Nothing is smuggled and no second request is planted, so
a scan does not tamper with anyone else's traffic.

That restraint costs certainty, and every finding says so: a delay is strong
evidence, not proof. ``--enable-desync`` trades the restraint for proof, and is
off by default because the confirmation genuinely can disrupt other users.
