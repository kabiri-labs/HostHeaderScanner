"""Finding the request headers a cache does not key on but a back-end honours.

A cache key is built from the method, host, path and query. A header field that
changes the response without appearing in that key gets the changed response
filed under the *unchanged* key - and served to everyone who asks for it next.

The existing cache-poisoning check tries six well-known names. Real holes are
rarely in the six anyone would guess, so this searches instead: candidates are
sent in batches, and a batch that moves the response is bisected until the
header responsible is isolated. Roughly log2(n) requests per hit rather than n.

Only header fields an intermediary sets are candidates. That is where cache
holes actually live, and it is also what makes the finding mean something: the
requirement being verified is that a header set by a load balancer or proxy
cannot be overridden by the end user.
