"""Turning a scan into per-control evidence.

A findings report answers "what did you break?". An assessor asks the other
question: "for each requirement, did this product meet it, and how do you know?"
This module answers that one.

The distinction that makes the answer worth anything is between a control that
was assessed and found clean, and one that was never assessed at all. A scan of
an unreachable host produces no findings; reporting that as full compliance
would be worse than producing no report. So a control is only ``Pass`` when a
check that covers it actually completed, and otherwise says why not.
