"""Comparing a scan against a stored baseline.

A team that has accepted its current findings does not want a pipeline that
fails on all of them forever; it wants to know what changed. This compares a
scan against a previous one and reports what is new, what is fixed and what is
unchanged.

The whole thing turns on giving a finding an identity that survives between
scans. Several checks put a fresh random marker in every payload - that is what
makes their findings proof rather than guesswork - and a cache-buster lands in
the URL. Hashing those verbatim would make every finding look new on every run,
which is worse than having no baseline at all: the pipeline would fail forever
and the feature would be switched off. So marker-shaped tokens are folded out
before hashing.
